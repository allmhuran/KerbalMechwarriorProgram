# Introduction

This release includes a patched version of the BD Armory plugin. This patch is required for Kerbal Mechwarrior Program until
the fixes are incorporated into the base plugin by papa_joe.

You will also need Infernal Robotics, the IR rework pack, and Kerbal OS.

This mod adds a large number of parts, and I have not yet created a plugin to put them in their own tab. Sorry! Most of them 
are under "structural", and all of the mech parts will be grouped together. You can search for them with the tag "MEK" or
manufacturer "Strana Kerbty".
