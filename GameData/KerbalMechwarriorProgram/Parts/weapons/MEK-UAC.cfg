	description = The Ultra Autocannon is a high caliber projectile weapon designed to fire multiple shots in quick succession each firing cycle. Trajectory stabilized HEAP ammunition deals direct damage plus a small amount of splash damage. Approximately equal to the medium laser at point blank range, but has no falloff. Shells will airburst at 700m.
