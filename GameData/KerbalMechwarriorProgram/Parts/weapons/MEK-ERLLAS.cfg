	description = If you're the kind of mechwarrior who prefers to end the fight before it even begins, this is the weapon for you. Effective out to extreme range and packs double the punch of the ERSLAS even at point blank range, but consumes a large amount of energy, having the highest damage per energy consumed only when the target is beyond ~700m.
